This "Ice Cream" website is made as a learning project and not all the
envisioned functionalities are fully implemented. I focused on learning
different concepts and improving the ability to translate a design into a
functional web presence as this project was done based on a provided Figma
design.

Think of it as a glimpse into the potential of a brand, built with a focus on
aesthetics and user engagement.
